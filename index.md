intro: 
  - excerpt: "I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Physics at UC Berkeley in Prof. Feng Wang's group, focusing on strongly correlated two-dimensional electron systems. I earned my Bachelor of Science (2020) in Physics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). I also gained research experience at UC Berkeley as an undergraduate researcher in 2019.

  I bring advanced scanning probe techniques to quantum materials research, broadly including four key research themes. (1) Quantum many-body phenomena leverages scanning tunneling microscopy for studying Wigner crystals, quantum melting, and correlated electron systems with single-electron sensitivity. (2) Moiré superlattices focuses on van der Waals heterostructures and artificial atoms to explore exotic quantum phases and emergent phenomena. (3) Advanced microscopy techniques addresses photocurrent tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy variants, and multi-modal characterization for comprehensive materials understanding. (4) Two-dimensional materials integrates mechanical exfoliation, device fabrication, and polymer stacking to create novel quantum systems for fundamental physics studies.

  I was awarded the Kavli Fellowship at UC Berkeley's Kavli Energy NanoScience Institute (2024-2025). Before that, I spent time doing research at UC Berkeley as an undergraduate and contributed to machine learning applications in 2D materials identification.

  [New] I'm expecting to graduate in 2025. Feel free to contact me if you know of a position for which I could be a fit."
