This directory contains placeholder images for publications. Replace these placeholders with actual publication figures:

- `quantum-melting-placeholder.jpg` - Figure for "Imaging quantum melting in a disordered 2D Wigner solid"
- `luttinger-liquid-placeholder.jpg` - Figure for "Imaging tunable Luttinger liquid systems"
- `wigner-molecular-placeholder.jpg` - Figure for "Wigner molecular crystals"
- `moire-excited-states-placeholder.jpg` - Figure for "Imaging moir√© excited states"
- `charge-excitations-placeholder.jpg` - Figure for "Mapping charge excitations"
- `electron-localization-placeholder.jpg` - Figure for "Visualizing electron localization"

Each image should be approximately 150px wide and maintain aspect ratio for best display.
