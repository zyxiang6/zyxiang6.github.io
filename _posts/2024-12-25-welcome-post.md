Welcome to my research website! I'm Ziyu Xiang (向子钰), a PhD student in Physics at UC Berkeley working under the guidance of Prof. Feng Wang. 

## My Research Focus

I study **strongly correlated 2D electron systems** using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. My work focuses on understanding quantum many-body phenomena in novel 2D materials, particularly:

- **Moiré superlattices** and their exotic electronic properties
- **Wigner molecular crystals** in twisted bilayer graphene
- **Luttinger liquid behavior** in one-dimensional systems
- **Charge excitations** in quantum Hall systems
- **Electron localization** in disordered systems

## Current Projects

My research involves using advanced experimental techniques to probe the electronic properties of quantum materials at the nanoscale. I use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to visualize and understand the behavior of electrons in these fascinating systems.

## Academic Background

I'm currently on the **2025-2026 academic job market**, seeking postdoctoral positions in condensed matter physics. My work has been published in top-tier journals including Science, Nature, and Nature Materials.

## Recent Publications

Some of my recent work includes:

- **Quantum melting of a nodal Wigner crystal** in twisted bilayer graphene (Science, 2024)
- **Luttinger liquid behavior** in one-dimensional systems (Nature, 2024)  
- **Wigner molecular crystals** with correlations (Science, 2024)
- **Moiré excited states** in transition metal dichalcogenides (Nature Materials, 2024)

You can find my complete publication list on my [publications page](/publications/) or visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-bXvJDMAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Contact and Collaboration

I'm always interested in discussing research collaborations and opportunities. Feel free to reach out through my [contact information](/about/).
