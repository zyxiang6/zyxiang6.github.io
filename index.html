        <h2 class="about-title">About</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
          <p>I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Physics at UC Berkeley, supervised by Prof. Feng Wang and also a member of the Ultrafast Nano-Optics Group. I earned my B.Sc. (2020) in Physics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) advised by Prof. Wu Zhou. I also served as a research assistant at UC Berkeley with Prof. Feng Wang during my undergraduate studies.</p>
          
          <p>I bring advanced experimental techniques to quantum materials research and condensed matter physics, broadly including four key research themes. (1) <strong>Quantum many-body phenomena</strong> leverages scanning tunneling microscopy for studying Wigner crystals, quantum melting, and strongly correlated electron systems across large-scale 2D materials. (2) <strong>Moiré superlattices</strong> focuses on artificial atoms and excited states, ensuring reliable characterization of van der Waals heterostructures in real-world measurements. (3) <strong>Advanced microscopy</strong> addresses photocurrent tunneling microscopy, spatial resolution enhancement, and single-electron sensitivity, promoting precise quantum state imaging. (4) <strong>2D material fabrication</strong> integrates various techniques—from exfoliation to lithography—to enhance device performance and experimental capability in quantum material systems.</p>

          <div class="highlight-notice">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> I will be on the academic job market 2026. Feel free to contact me if you know of a position for which I could be a fit.</p>
