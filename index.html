excerpt: "PhD student in Physics at UC Berkeley studying strongly correlated 2D electron systems with scanning tunneling microscopy"
intro: 
  - excerpt: "I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Physics at UC Berkeley, supervised by Prof. Feng Wang and working in the Ultrafast Nano-Optics Group. I earned my B.Sc. (2020) in Physics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). I also served as a research assistant at UC Berkeley during my undergraduate studies under Prof. Feng Wang's supervision.

I bring advanced experimental techniques to quantum materials research and condensed matter physics, broadly including four key research themes. (1) Scanning probe microscopy leverages STM and AFM for sub-nanometer imaging, spectroscopy, and characterization of strongly correlated electron systems. (2) Quantum many-body phenomena focuses on understanding Wigner crystals, Luttinger liquids, and quantum melting transitions in 2D materials. (3) Moiré superlattices addresses excited states, artificial atoms, and emergent correlated phases in van der Waals heterostructures. (4) Advanced materials characterization integrates multiple experimental techniques—from photocurrent tunneling microscopy to optical spectroscopy—to enhance our understanding of quantum materials and their applications.

I will join a leading quantum materials research group as a postdoc in 2025. Before that, I spent time doing research at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and was awarded the Kavli Fellowship at UC Berkeley.

**[New]** I'm on the academic job market 2025. Feel free to contact me if you know of a position for which I could be a fit."
