excerpt: "PhD student in Physics at UC Berkeley studying strongly correlated 2D electron systems with scanning tunneling microscopy"
intro: 
  - excerpt: "I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Physics at UC Berkeley, supervised by Prof. Feng Wang and also a member of the Ultrafast Nano-Optics Group. I earned my B.Sc. (2020) in Physics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) advised by Prof. Wu Zhou. I also served as a research assistant at UC Berkeley with Prof. Feng Wang during my undergraduate studies.

I bring advanced experimental techniques to quantum materials research and condensed matter physics, broadly including four key research themes. (1) Quantum many-body phenomena leverages scanning tunneling microscopy for studying Wigner crystals, quantum melting, and strongly correlated electron systems across large-scale 2D materials. (2) Moiré superlattices focuses on artificial atoms and excited states, ensuring reliable characterization of van der Waals heterostructures in real-world measurements. (3) Advanced microscopy addresses photocurrent tunneling microscopy, spatial resolution enhancement, and single-electron sensitivity, promoting precise quantum state imaging. (4) 2D material fabrication integrates various techniques—from exfoliation to lithography—to enhance device performance and experimental capability in quantum material systems.

I will continue my research at UC Berkeley through 2025. Before that, I spent time doing research at UC Berkeley during my undergraduate studies and at UCAS with various experimental physics groups.

[New] I will be on the academic job market 2025-2026. Feel free to contact me if you know of a position for which I could be a fit."
