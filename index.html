## About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Physics at the University of California, Berkeley, working in Prof. Feng Wang's group. I earned my B.Sc. (2020) in Physics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), Beijing. I also served as a research assistant at UC Berkeley during my undergraduate studies in Prof. Feng Wang's group.

I apply advanced scanning probe techniques to study strongly correlated two-dimensional electron systems, broadly including four key research themes. (1) **Quantum many-body physics** leverages scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to investigate Wigner crystals, quantum melting, and correlated electron states with single-electron sensitivity. (2) **Moiré superlattices** focuses on understanding artificial atoms, excited states, and novel quantum phases in van der Waals heterostructures. (3) **Advanced microscopy techniques** addresses photocurrent tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and multi-modal characterization of 2D materials. (4) **Materials fabrication** integrates device assembly, lithography, and clean room techniques to create high-quality van der Waals heterostructures for fundamental physics studies.

I was awarded the Kavli Graduate Student Fellowship at the Kavli Energy NanoScience Institute, UC Berkeley in 2024. Before that, I spent time doing research at UC Berkeley and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

**[New]** I'm defending my PhD in 2025. Feel free to contact me if you know of a postdoc position for which I could be a fit.
