## About Ziyu Xiang

I am a Postdoctoral researcher in Physics at the University of California, Berkeley, working in Prof. Feng Wang's group. I earned my PhD (2025) in Physics from UC Berkeley. My research focuses on studying strongly correlated two-dimensional electron systems using advanced scanning probe techniques, particularly scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

### Research Focus

My research involves applying cutting-edge experimental techniques to study:

- **Quantum many-body systems** in two-dimensional materials
- **Wigner crystals and quantum melting** in disordered systems
- **Luttinger liquid physics** in van der Waals heterostructures
- **Moiré excited states** and artificial atoms
- **Strongly correlated electron systems** with single-electron sensitivity

### Technical Expertise

**Experimental Techniques:**
- Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) with sub-nanometer spatial resolution
- Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) including SNOM, PFM, and TFM modes
- Photocurrent tunneling microscopy
- 2D material exfoliation and device fabrication
- Various lithography techniques (AFM, photo, e-beam)
- Optical spectroscopy (absorption, PL, Raman)

**Materials & Fabrication:**
- Van der Waals heterostructure assembly
- Polymer stacking techniques (PPC, PET, PC)
- BN-sliding technique for twist angle control
- Shadow-mask contact growth
- Plasma etching and wire bonding

**Skills:**
- Machine learning for graphene image identification
- Advanced data analysis and modeling
- Clean room fabrication techniques
